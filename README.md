# KSSCore
Miscellaneous Swift utilities

## Description

This package is divided into a number of Swift Modules providing utility methods related to both
UI and non-UI classes. At present the UI is only supported on macOS and the non-UI items are
supported on both macOS and Linux.

The modules provided by this package are the following:

* _KSSFoundation_ - items that depend on nothing but the Foundation classes,
* _KSSCocoa_ - items that depend on Foundation and Cocoa, and
* _KSSUI_ - items that depend on Foundation and SwiftUI
* _KSSMap_ - items that depend on MapKit
