# KSSCore
Miscellaneous non-UI Swift utilities

## Description

This package is divided into a number of Swift Modules providing utility methods related to both
UI and non-UI classes. At present only _KSSFoundation_ and _KSSTest_ are available on both Mac 
and Linux. The remaining modules are only available on Mac.

The modules provided by this package are the following:

* _KSSFoundation_ - items that depend on nothing but the Foundation classes
* _KSSTest_ - items that depend on XCTest
* _KSSUI_ - items that depend on Foundation and SwiftUI
