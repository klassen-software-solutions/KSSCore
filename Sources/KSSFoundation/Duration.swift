 Enumeration to specify the unit of a given duration. The raw value of the enumeration is a TimeInterval

 This conversion is only approximate and does not consider leap years or even the difference between
 months. For example, one year will always be considered 365 days and one month will always be considered
 30 days. For more accurate durations you will need to use the `Date` and related classes directly.
